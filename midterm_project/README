This project processes images in the PPM format, applying operations like inversion, zooming,
and Gaussian blur to manipulate and transform images. It emphasizes modular design by breaking
functionality into separate files for PPM I/O, image manipulation, and the main program logic.
Advanced techniques in C include dynamic memory allocation, struct-based image representation,
pointer arithmetic for efficient pixel access, and 2D convolution for operations like blurring.
It also builds upon error handling, file I/O, and the use of header files to organize and
modularize code.
