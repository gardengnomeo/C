This project implements a word search puzzle solver using C, leveraging a structured
approach with reusable functions and robust testing. The program reads a grid of letters
from a file, searches for words entered by the user or through redirected input, and
identifies the location and orientation (diagonal, anti-diagonal, etc.) of each word in
the grid. Key functionality includes grid validation, directional searches, and output
formatting, all organized in modular files: word_search.c, search_functions.h,
search_functions.c, and test_search_functions.c. The project employs a 2D array for
the grid and adheres to clear constraints such as a maximum grid size of 10x10, strict
input formats, and output standards. Testing and debugging are streamlined through
provided scaffolding, a Makefile for builds, and structured test cases using assertions.
